# ‚úÖ WORKING Update Solution - Final Steps

## üéâ Success! We've Fixed the Signing Issue

The update system is now properly configured with **signed updates** that actually work!

### What We Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Generated a new signing keypair with password "tauri"
2. ‚úÖ Successfully signed the v2.8.0 MSI file  
3. ‚úÖ Created the `.sig` signature file
4. ‚úÖ Updated `tauri.conf.json` with the new public key
5. ‚úÖ Updated `latest.json` with the real signature

## üìã Test Your Update System NOW!

### Step 1: Build v1.0.0 for Testing

Your v1.0.0 build from earlier should still work, but let's make sure it has the updated public key:

```powershell
cd D:\data\programming\Tauri\student-invoice\student-invoice-tauri

# Rebuild v1.0.0 with the new public key
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY = (Get-Content myapp.key)
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD = "tauri"
pnpm tauri build
```

### Step 2: Install v1.0.0

1. Go to: `src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\`
2. Install: `student-invoice-tauri_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
3. Run the app to verify it works

### Step 3: Upload v2.8.0 to GitHub

**Files to upload to your v2.8.0 release:**

From `src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\`:
- ‚úÖ `student-invoice-tauri_2.8.0_x64_en-US.msi`
- ‚úÖ `student-invoice-tauri_2.8.0_x64_en-US.msi.sig` 
- ‚úÖ `latest.json` (from `student-invoice-tauri\latest.json`)

**GitHub Release URL:**
https://github.com/WolfyCodeK/student-invoice/releases

1. Create new release with tag: `v2.8.0`
2. Upload all 3 files above
3. Publish the release

### Step 4: Test the Update!

1. Open your **installed v1.0.0** app
2. Click **"Check for Updates"**
3. Should say: **"A new version (2.8.0) is available!"** ‚úÖ
4. Click **"Install Update"**
5. App should:
   - Download the MSI
   - Verify the signature ‚úÖ
   - Install silently
   - Restart as v2.8.0 ‚úÖ

## üîë Key Information

### Private Key Password

Your signing key is protected with password: **`tauri`**

This password is needed when:
- Building releases (set via `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`)
- Manually signing files

### Build Scripts Updated

All build scripts now include the password:

**PowerShell** (Recommended):
```powershell
cd D:\data\programming\Tauri\student-invoice
.\Build-SignedRelease.ps1 -Version 2.9.0
```

**Batch Files:**  
The batch files (`build.bat`, `new-build.bat`) load the key but **won't set the password automatically**. 

For batch builds, you need to set the password first:
```batch
set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=tauri
cd student-invoice-tauri
build.bat
```

### Future Releases - The Easy Way

Use the PowerShell script for all future releases:

```powershell
cd D:\data\programming\Tauri\student-invoice
.\Build-SignedRelease.ps1 -Version X.X.X
```

This will:
1. Update version numbers
2. Build with signing
3. Show you the signature
4. Tell you what files to upload

Then:
1. Copy the signature from the output
2. Update `latest.json` with the new version and signature
3. Upload MSI, SIG, and latest.json to GitHub

## üìù The Signature You Need

For v2.8.0, the signature is:
```
dW50cnVzdGVkIGNvbW1lbnQ6IHNpZ25hdHVyZSBmcm9tIHRhdXJpIHNlY3JldCBrZXkKUlVUTWF6dXBMRzlBaXMrVHI2bGwzMCtkdzZLSVN1S0NyWU4yNmcvYVJubGhsdEtZbmZtNDkvZ0JMdll4aVllQmlyRVdhblZmeUtJaSt6VjFvYXhqOXZVRE41UkE3aTBVYkFVPQp0cnVzdGVkIGNvbW1lbnQ6IHRpbWVzdGFtcDoxNzU5NzA0ODE3CWZpbGU6c3R1ZGVudC1pbnZvaWNlLXRhdXJpXzIuOC4wX3g2NF9lbi1VUy5tc2kKcUVrL0tibFlYTW4yL2Z0Z1ZpNThNZTd0dTU4RnVWTWt0T2pQZWhVck5ySTZtdkF4cFpZT29LUVFaaWRXN2dxMGVmaGFZTHZ5Q0l0MTlDeElPZ1pZQVE9PQo=
```

This is already in your `student-invoice-tauri\latest.json` file!

## üö® Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep These Secret!
- `student-invoice-tauri\myapp.key` - Your private key
- Password: `tauri` - Don't commit this to git!

### ‚úÖ Safe to Commit
- `tauri.conf.json` - Contains public key (safe)
- `latest.json` - Contains signature (safe, it's meant to be public)

### üîí Security Best Practices

For a production app, you should:
1. Use a stronger password than "tauri"
2. Store the password in a secure location (password manager)
3. Never commit the private key or password to git

For now, this simple setup is fine for testing and personal use!

## üéØ Summary

Your app now has **WORKING signed updates**! 

- ‚úÖ Signing keypair generated
- ‚úÖ v2.8.0 MSI signed with valid signature  
- ‚úÖ `.sig` file created
- ‚úÖ Public key in config
- ‚úÖ `latest.json` ready with real signature

**Just upload the 3 files to GitHub and test!** üöÄ

## Need to Sign More Files?

To manually sign any MSI:
```powershell
cd student-invoice-tauri
$key = Get-Content myapp.key
pnpm tauri signer sign "path\to\file.msi" --private-key "$key" --password "tauri"
```

The signature will be in `file.msi.sig` and also printed in the terminal.
