# üöÄ Next Steps - Test Your Update System

## What We Just Did

‚úÖ Generated signing keypair (myapp.key + public key)  
‚úÖ Updated tauri.conf.json with your public key  
‚úÖ Updated build scripts to automatically sign releases  
‚úÖ Added signing keys to .gitignore (they won't be committed)  

## Test It Now!

### Step 1: Build v1.0.0 (Your Test Version)
```batch
cd D:\data\programming\Tauri\student-invoice\student-invoice-tauri
# First, update version to 1.0.0
cd ..
set-version.bat 1.0.0
cd student-invoice-tauri
pnpm tauri build
```

The build will:
- Create `student-invoice-tauri_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
- Create `student-invoice-tauri_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi.sig` ‚Üê **This is new!**

### Step 2: Install v1.0.0
1. Go to `student-invoice-tauri\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\`
2. Install `student-invoice-tauri_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
3. Run the app to make sure it works

### Step 3: Build v2.7.0 (Your Update Version)
```batch
cd D:\data\programming\Tauri\student-invoice
release.bat 2.7.0
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub Release for v2.7.0

1. **Find your built files:**
   - `student-invoice-tauri_2.7.0_x64_en-US.msi`
   - `student-invoice-tauri_2.7.0_x64_en-US.msi.sig` ‚Üê **Important!**

2. **Get the signature:**
   ```powershell
   cd student-invoice-tauri\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi
   Get-Content student-invoice-tauri_2.7.0_x64_en-US.msi.sig
   ```
   Copy the output (long base64 string)

3. **Update latest.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "2.7.0",
     "notes": "Student Invoice 2.7.0",
     "pub_date": "2025-10-05T18:00:00Z",
     "platforms": {
       "windows-x86_64": {
         "signature": "PASTE_THE_SIGNATURE_HERE",
         "url": "https://github.com/WolfyCodeK/student-invoice/releases/download/v2.7.0/student-invoice-tauri_2.7.0_x64_en-US.msi"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/WolfyCodeK/student-invoice/releases
   - Create release with tag `v2.7.0`
   - Upload:
     - `student-invoice-tauri_2.7.0_x64_en-US.msi`
     - `student-invoice-tauri_2.7.0_x64_en-US.msi.sig`
     - `latest.json` (with the signature filled in)

### Step 5: Test the Update!

1. Open your installed v1.0.0 app
2. Click "Check for Updates" button
3. Should say "A new version (2.7.0) is available!" ‚úÖ
4. Click "Install Update"
5. App should download, verify signature, and install
6. App restarts as v2.7.0 ‚úÖ

## If It Still Fails...

Check these common issues:

1. **"Invalid signature" error**
   - Did you upload the `.sig` file to GitHub?
   - Did you paste the signature into `latest.json`?
   - Is the URL in `latest.json` correct?

2. **"Failed to download" error**
   - Is the MSI file uploaded to GitHub?
   - Is the URL correct in `latest.json`?
   - Try accessing the URL in a browser

3. **App crashes on startup**
   - Make sure `myapp.key` exists in `student-invoice-tauri/` folder
   - Make sure the public key is in `tauri.conf.json`

## Important Files

- **Private Key**: `student-invoice-tauri/myapp.key` ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep secret!
- **Public Key**: In `tauri.conf.json` (safe to commit)
- **Signatures**: `.sig` files created during build (upload to GitHub)

## Future Releases

Every time you want to release:
```batch
release.bat X.X.X
```

Then:
1. Get signature from .sig file
2. Update latest.json
3. Upload MSI, SIG, and latest.json to GitHub

The build script automatically signs everything for you!
