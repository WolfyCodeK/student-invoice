# Auto-Update Fix Summary

## Issues Found

### 1. **Installer Format Mismatch** (Primary Issue)
**Problem:** Your `latest.json` was pointing to an `.exe` file, but with `installMode: "passive"` configured in `tauri.conf.json`, Tauri expects an `.msi` installer for Windows passive installation.

**Files affected:**
- `student-invoice-tauri/latest.json` - pointed to `*_x64-setup.exe`
- `release.bat` - was generating latest.json with `.exe` URL

**Fix:** Updated both files to point to the correct MSI installer format:
- Changed URL from: `student-invoice-tauri_2.4.0_x64-setup.exe`
- Changed URL to: `student-invoice-tauri_2.4.0_x64_en-US.msi`

### 2. **Misleading Error Messages**
**Problem:** The Rust error handling was catching signature-related errors and incorrectly reporting them as "development mode" issues, hiding the real problem.

**File affected:** `student-invoice-tauri/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

**Fix:** 
- Removed the misleading error message translation
- Added proper logging with `println!` and `eprintln!` statements
- Now returns actual error messages to the frontend
- Added debug output to track the update process

### 3. **Frontend Error Handling**
**Problem:** Frontend was filtering error messages and showing custom "development mode" messages that obscured the real issues.

**File affected:** `student-invoice-tauri/src/App.tsx`

**Fix:**
- Simplified error handling to show actual error messages
- Added console logging for debugging
- Removed the misleading development mode check

## What You Need to Do

### For Testing:

1. **Rebuild your v1.0.0 app:**
   ```batch
   cd student-invoice-tauri
   pnpm tauri build
   ```

2. **Make sure v2.4.0 MSI is uploaded to GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/WolfyCodeK/student-invoice/releases/tag/v2.4.0
   - Verify the file `student-invoice-tauri_2.4.0_x64_en-US.msi` exists
   - Upload the new `latest.json` file to the release

3. **Test the update:**
   - Install the v1.0.0 build
   - Click "Check for Updates"
   - Click "Install Update"
   - Watch the console output for debug messages

### For Future Releases:

The `release.bat` script has been fixed, so future releases will automatically generate the correct `latest.json` format pointing to MSI installers.

## Technical Details

### Why MSI for Passive Mode?
- `installMode: "passive"` requires an installer that can run without user interaction
- MSI installers support silent/passive installation natively on Windows
- NSIS `.exe` installers can work but require different configuration

### Why Empty Signature?
- With `"pubkey": ""` in `tauri.conf.json`, signature verification is disabled
- This is fine for personal/small projects
- For production apps, consider generating a keypair for signed updates

### Updater Configuration Summary:
```json
{
  "updater": {
    "active": true,
    "endpoints": ["https://github.com/.../latest.json"],
    "dialog": false,  // ✓ Correct - you handle UI manually
    "pubkey": "",     // ✓ Correct - disables signature verification
    "windows": {
      "installMode": "passive"  // ✓ Correct - requires MSI
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Check for Updates:** Should detect v2.4.0 is available
2. **Install Update:** Should download the MSI and install it
3. **Restart:** App should restart automatically with the new version
4. **Error Messages:** If it fails, you'll now see the ACTUAL error message

## Debugging

If you still encounter issues, check the console output for messages like:
- "Update available: 1.0.0 -> 2.4.0"
- "Updater obtained successfully"
- "Update found: version 2.4.0"
- "Downloading and installing update..."
- "Download progress: X/Y bytes"

Any errors will now be clearly logged with the real error message.
